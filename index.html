<h3>Hello Everyone ......</h3>
<p>Here I'm going to build a CI/CD pipeline with Dynamic Distributed Cluster.<br><br>
<strong>Dynamic Distributed</strong> Cluster is made in such a way that whenever developer commits code and the Dockerfile, the image created and uploaded automatically on docker hub.
<br>Using that Dockerfile as well as slave node will launch and the website is deployed on k8s.</p>
